The Classic Build Engine Game Blood... Running inside of DOS BOX ... Inside of a Web Browser... On Heroku...

I am unabashedly giddy about this.

<h1>It aint perfect. It aint pretty. but by God it works. Using JS-DOS 6.22</h1>

I'd like to add persistance. Currently all progress will be lost once the browser session is closed. This is possible, but somewhat tricky for multiple instances.  


Performance isn't great. 2D side scrollers seem to work better than 3D games. 

The application will start a setup.exe - Feel free to tinker with the settings if you want, or simply start the game by choosing the last option on the setup menu. 

<h3>Adlib Music seems to work</h3>
<h3>Soundblaster Audio seems to work</h3>
<h4>HEADPHONE WARNING : The audio takes a second to kick in and may crackle loudly when first starting.</h4> 

<h3>Emulation will respond to the normal CTRL + F11 or CTRL + F12 DOS BOX control for CPU speed Emulation. Pressing CTRL + F12 at startup does increase FPS and performance</h3>

See it deployed and play it!
