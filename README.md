<h1>It aint perfect. It aint pretty. but by God it works. Using JS-DOS 6.22</h1>

I'd like to add persistance. Currently there is no way to save a game. This is possible, but somewhat tricky. 




Performance isn't great. 2D side scrollers seem to work better than 3D games. 

The application will start a setup.exe - Feel free to tinker with the settings if you want, or simply start the game.

<h3>Adlib Music seems to work</h3>
<h3>Soundblaster Audio seems to work</h3>

See it deployed and play it!
