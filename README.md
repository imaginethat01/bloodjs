The Classic Build Engine Game Blood... Running inside of DOS BOX ... Inside of a Web Browser... On Heroku...

<h1>It aint perfect. It aint pretty. but by God it works. Using JS-DOS 6.22</h1>

I'd like to add persistance. Currently there is no way to save a game. This is possible, but somewhat tricky. 

Sound doesn't work either. I'm not surprised. 

Performance isn't great. 2D side scrollers seem to work better than 3D games. 

The application will start a setup.exe - Feel free to tinker with the settings if you want, or simply start the game.


See it deployed and play it!
